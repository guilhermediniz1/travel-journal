# Travel Journal - React.js
⚛️ This is a very simple project that I did to practice my new knowledge in React.js

⚛️ The main concept used, was the use of *"props"* to pass the data and make reusable components and more composable code.

⚛️ I'm currently studying React.js using the Scrimba plataform (*https://scrimba.com/*).
